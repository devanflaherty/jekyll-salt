## A Blank Slate
Over the last few years a CNC machine went for sale locally in the Flathead Valley, but it wasn't for long. Two friends came together to purchase the machine and together started **Stonecraft**. In a fairly large warehouse, surrounded by top of the line stone slabs, of granite, marble, Quartz and more, there lies the behemoth of a machine and team of people looking to provide the highest quality of counters.

**Stonecraft's** main goal was to develop a brand that would be masculine yet at the same time would be appealing to their main demographic of home designers. The business has grown immensely, providing counters all over the north west and looking to expand to Hawaii.

There were a lot of initial thoughts that had to be sifted through, so I started off by creating a perverbial box and began to make decisions on what was allowed and what wasn't in their brand. As I created the list the one image I kept coming back to was some sort of typeface chiseled into their slab. I really felt the typeface needed to be strong and feel natural when engraved on one of their slabs. That helped limit the available typefaces I wanted to go with, and after a few revisions we landed on something.

#### Precision and Trust
It was really important to me that the brand communicated two things: Precision & Trust. When you are hiring a business to install top of the line counters, you want them to be made with precision, and trust that your money and dream home is in the right hands. When it came to colors I knew I wanted stark contrast of black and white to be present, nothing is more precise than white against black but to communicate trust I kept coming to this vibrant blue similar to a blueprint. A blueprint expresses the idea of having a plan, coming prepared, knowing every detail down to the centimeter. I presented the idea and the loved it.
