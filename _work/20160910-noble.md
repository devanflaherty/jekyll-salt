## Some nobilty
I'm no fool to the fact that there are more than enough RSS readers in the world. Which is interesting due to it has been announced dead for years, yet I still find my self getting a lot of my news and staying up to date with my favorite brands and personalities through RSS. Why? Because it's so dirt simple and when done right doesn't give you anything more than what you need. One summer I was curious what would I create if I made my own RSS reader. Enter Noble.

#### Not revolutionary, and that's why it works
So many of these news services give us so much more than what we've bargained for. Wether it be adds, unneeded features, or over complicated and animated navigational elements. Noble seeks out to do one thing, and one thing really well, deliver your RSS feeds to you beautifully without any distractions.

Noble is opinionated, rather than giving the user font options and size options we make an educated decision on what the best font and font size is. Images are full width, why make a user click to see an image full-screen when we can just show them directly in their feed? Also if you get distracted, or simply want to get to RSS 0 but save some article to read later just pull down and you'll get the option to book-mark, then swipe right and continue on to the next article. Couldn't be easier.

#### Everything should be beautiful

I really wanted every screen, every step of the Noble experience to feel beautiful, even when adding a feed I wanted to make the experience fun and welcoming.

> Noble might have just been a concept, but more than that, it is a dream. A dream that we can create beautiful work that isn't bloated with crap.
